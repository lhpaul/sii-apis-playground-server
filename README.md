# SII APIs Playground Server

This repository contains the server which serves the SII APIs Playground app with services.

## What's Inside?

This monorepo includes the following packages and applications:

### Apps and Packages

- `public-api`: A [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) application that provides a REST API implementation. Designed for secure internet-facing access with robust authentication and authorization protocols such as OIDC.
- `@repo/configs`: Shared configuration files for ESLint, Jest, Prettier and TypeScript to ensure consistent code quality and style across all packages.
- `@repo/fastify`: Shared Fastify utilities and plugins providing common server functionality, middleware, and helper methods.
- `@repo/shared`: Shared business logic including domain models, services, interfaces and utilities used across all applications.

### Development Tools

This monorepo comes pre-configured with essential development tools:

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) Fast, disk space efficient package manager.
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) for efficient monorepo management and shared library handling.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for robust type checking.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code quality and consistency.

## Getting Started

### Setup

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Node.js version 22 (we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for version management)
2. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) package manager.
3. Turborepo CLI globally installed:

   ```bash
   pnpm install turbo --global
   ```

#### Installation

Install all repository dependencies by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build

The build process will create optimized production bundles in the `dist` directory of each package.

To build all applications and packages in the monorepo:

```bash
# Build for production (with optimizations)
pnpm build
```

You can also build individual packages or applications by navigating to their respective directories:

```bash
# Example: Building a shared package
cd packages/shared
pnpm run build

# Example: Building a specific application
cd apps/public-api
pnpm run build
```

### Development

This project contains multiple applications that can be run independently. For development, we use development builds that support hot-reloading and provide better debugging capabilities.

To start development, choose one of the following applications:

#### Public API

```bash
pnpm run dev:public-api
```

> **Note**: Each application may require specific environment variables to function properly. Check the `.env.example` file in each application's directory and create a `.env` file with the required variables before starting the development server.

### Testing

The project uses Jest as the testing framework. Here's how to run tests:

#### Running All Tests

To run tests across all apps and packages from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

#### Running Specific Tests

To run tests for a specific app or package:

1. Navigate to the target directory:

```bash
cd packages/shared  # or any other package/app directory
```

2. Run the tests:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

#### Test Coverage

Each package and app generates test coverage reports. To view detailed coverage information:

1. Navigate to the package/app directory
2. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser
