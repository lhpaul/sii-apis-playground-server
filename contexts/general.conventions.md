# General conventions

This document outlines the general conventions used in this repository. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency and maintainability.

## File Naming Suffixes

Use the following suffixes in filenames (before the extension, e.g., `users.service.ts`) to indicate the file's purpose:

- `.constants.ts`: Contains constant values. No logic should be included.
- `.errors.ts`: Defines custom error classes with minimal logic.
- `.interfaces.ts`: Holds TypeScript interfaces and type definitions. No logic should be included.
- `.service.ts`: Implements classes that encapsulate core business logic or interact with data sources.
- `.utils.ts`: Contains reusable utility functions, typically pure and stateless.
- `.class.ts`: Defines utility classes.
- `.mocks.ts`: Provides mock classes, constants, or functions for testing purposes.

## Masking Sensitive Information

When developing, ensure that sensitive data is properly masked in logs to protect user privacy and security. Sensitive information includes, but is not limited to:

- Credentials, such as passwords or API keys.
- Personally identifiable information (PII), including email addresses, phone numbers, full names, and identification numbers.

When defining a new endpoint (e.g., `src/endpoints/<endpoint-name>/<endpoint-name>.endpoint.ts`), specify the fields to be masked in both request and response logs.

**Example:**

```typescript
export const usersEndpoint: RouteOptions = createEndpoint({
  method: ['POST'],
  path: '/users',
  handler: createUserHandler,
}, {
  maskOptions: {
    requestHeaders: ['authorization'],
    requestPayloadFields: ['lastName', 'email', 'phoneNumber'],
    responseHeaders: ['authorization'],
    responsePayloadFields: ['sensitiveField']
  }
});
```

Similarly, when making requests to external APIs, define which fields should be masked in the request and response logs.

**Example:**

```typescript
const { data: responseData, error } = await apiRequest<any>({
  method,
  url,
  payload,
  headers
}, {
  maskOptions: {
    requestPayloadFields: ['email', 'password'],
    requestHeaders: ['x-api-key'],
    responsePayloadFields: ['token']
  }
});
```
